--Example
Create table If Not Exists Seat (id int, student varchar(255))
Truncate table Seat
insert into Seat (id, student) values ('1', 'Abbot')
insert into Seat (id, student) values ('2', 'Doris')
insert into Seat (id, student) values ('3', 'Emerson')
insert into Seat (id, student) values ('4', 'Green')
insert into Seat (id, student) values ('5', 'Jeames')

  


--My Solution
SELECT
    id,
    CASE
        WHEN MOD(id,2)=1 THEN student_lead
        WHEN MOD(id,2)=0 THEN student_lag
    END AS student
FROM(
    SELECT
        id,
        student,
        LEAD(student,1,student) OVER(ORDER BY id) AS student_lead,
        LAG(student) OVER(ORDER BY id) AS student_lag
    FROM Seat
    ) AS T
ORDER BY id ASC



--Other Solution
SELECT 
    id, 
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN LAG(student) OVER(ORDER BY id)
        ELSE COALESCE(LEAD(student) OVER(ORDER BY id), student)
    END AS student
FROM Seat

626. Exchange Seats



Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
